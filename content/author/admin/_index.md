I am an Undergraduate NLP Researcher at the Language Technologies Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad. Currently, I am working on adversarial text generation, but I'm also generally interested in generative models and work on side projects on the same. I also have experience building commercial NLP tools using ML/DL.

Outside CS and ML, I love football, music, art and [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2011CHIN01).
